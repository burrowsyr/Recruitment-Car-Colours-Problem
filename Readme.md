Car Colour Sequence Problem
===

The busy Burrows dev team is observing cars passing the office window. They notice that there is occasionally a rather long sequence of cars of only *two* colours.

One time they observe `red, green, red, red, green`, a sequence of 5 cars sharing just two colours before a `blue` car comes along and ends the run.

Another time they observe `blue, yellow, black, yellow, green, yellow, yellow, red` and identify the two-colour sequence `yellow, green, yellow, yellow` as being longer than any of the other sequences.

The team decides to commission *you* to write a piece of software to find the longest sequence of two car colours so that they can all get on with something more productive.

Using a TDD approach, complete the method in this repo:

    public static int CalculateLongestSequenceOfTwoCarColours(IEnumerable<string> carColours)
